def NTfreq_fasta(input_file,check_NT=True,each_Gene=False):
  '''
  The NTfreq_fasta function takes in a FASTA file and returns a graph showing the frequency of each nucleotide within that file.
  It can also check whether the sequences are in valid format and show the results for each specific gene in the file.

  Parameters
  ----------
  input_file : should be a FASTA file that contains the gene names (denoted by '>') and the relevant nucleotide sequences, the file 
  needs to be available in the directory or environment that the function is being used in.
  
  check_NT : True or False
             If True the function checks whether the characters in each sequence all match the symbols for the standard NTs
  
  each_Gene : True or False
                 If True the function also returns NT frequency graphs for each specific gene

  # Please make sure that the FASTA file is in the correct format, i.e. that it contains only nucleotide sequences and that all gene names are denoted by
  # '>'. For further information on the the format please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format
  # Please note that this program does not support old FASTA format versions using semicolons (';') instead of '>'

  # The program/function is split into sections, denoted with comment lines
  # There is a brief explaination of what the code does at the beginning of each section
  # There are also addtional comments in the code to give further and more detailed explainations

  # For more detailed information please see README.md file
